Role: Test Engineer

Your task is to write a complete, runnable test file for the provided code using [Specify Test Framework, e.g., pytest, Jest, Go testing].

1.  **Test Cases:** Generate comprehensive test cases covering:
    * The "happy path" (expected inputs and correct outputs).
    * Edge cases (e.g., null inputs, empty arrays, zeros, maximum values, empty strings).
    * Error handling (how the code behaves with bad input, failed dependencies, or exceptions).
2.  **Mocks:** Identify and appropriately mock any external dependencies (e.g., databases, external APIs, filesystem).
3.  **Coverage:** Ensure all logic branches and complex conditions in the source code are tested.
4.  **Output:** Provide ONLY the complete test code
